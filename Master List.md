# The Technical Writer's Almanac Master List

Due to the mostly decentralized, consistently changing nature of an open source blog, it is difficult to establish a 
definitive Table of Contents. However, as any professional documentarian will remind you, organization is crucial for
a form of communication to be effective.

With this in mind, this page will organize almanac posts chronologically for users to use as a means to linearly access otherwise
non-linear posts. Each post will be assigned a number, followed by the **Title** of the post, **Author**, **Description** of the
post's content, and **Date** of release.

Posts will appear in order of most recent to least recent, *similar to the manner in which a podcast's archive UI is displayed*. 
The Technical Writer's Almanac administrators will oversee and update this page with each submittal.
