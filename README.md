# The Technical Writer's Almanac
An open-source collection of experiences, philosophies, ideas, and information pertaining to the (cross-disciplinary) field of Technical Writing.

## Purpose
Subject to change, the purpose behind the Technical Writer's Almanac is to serve as part blog, part resource repository for aspiring ***or*** current technical writers across any discipline.

## Why Open Source?
Because it's the future! Or perhaps it's [actually](https://thenewstack.io/survey-open-source-programs-are-a-best-practice-among-large-companies/ "Survey: Open Source Programs Are a Best Practice Among Large Companies") the present. We live and work in a world where each individual experience is unique, a reality that may become lost in most traditional single-voiced blogs. Technical Writing is a field that runs tangentially to a diverse array of other disciplines, and while we are unified by our passion for end user comprehension and our required abilities to write clearly and concisely, a technical writer documenting hardware in the field of Medical Devices may have had an entirely different experience from a technical writer documenting APIs for enterprise software. 

*Simply put, an open source blogging community allows for a repository of collective experiences, bridging the gap between the different factions of Technical Writing.*

## How Do I Contribute?

> It should be noted that this methodology may change as we discover more intuitive means to submitting contributions. Our commitment to inclusivity is our guiding principle, an arbitrary preference of an avenue of submittal is not.

### "But what if I'm not GitHub savvy? How do I contribute?"

As mentioned before, our mission statement is inclusivity within the field of Technical Writing. This means that documentarians of any product (whether it be lawn mowers or cloud based servers) are both welcome and highly encouraged to give us their voice. If you desire to submit an article, feel free to type it up in some sort of word processor (whether it be Microsoft Word / Google Drive / etc.) and e-mail it to tad.dieken@gmail.com. We will gladly take care of reformatting your article into Markdown so that our community can hear your voice.

It is also important to note that any changes made by admins (no matter how small) will be sent to the author for their approval. We are a multi-voiced medium and, as such, desire to ensure that authorial intent is prioritized.


## "What should I write about?"

Anything.

Well, OK maybe not quite ***everything***, but if it's something that's on your mind and pertains to the field of Technical Writing, then it's worth submitting. 

Want to share your story on how you got into Technical Writing? Tell us about it. Want to create a user manual on how to pry information out from reserved SMEs? Teach us. Do you have a call-to-action for how we can improve our field? Shout it from the rooftop and let us rally behind you. We're here to elevate, support, and learn - and we can't do it without *you*.

## "Who's in charge here?"

Well, *nobody*, really. However, if you're interested to learn more about the admins of this repository, feel free to visit **About the Admins**. That being said, we want to stress the importance we place on maintaining a singular plane, rather than a chain of command. This repository serves as a means for ***all voices***, and we will never prioritize one author over another.
