# The Technical Writer's Almanac
An open-source collection of experiences, philosophies, ideas, and information pertaining to the field of Technical Writing.

## Purpose
Subject to change, the purpose behind the Technical Writer's Almanac is to serve as part blog, part resource repository for aspiring ***or*** current technical writers across any discipline.

## Why Open Source?
Because it's the future! Or perhaps the present, actually. We live and work in a world where each individual experience is unique, a reality that may become lost in most traditional single-voiced blogs. Technical Writing is a field that runs tangentially to a diverse array of other disciplines, and while we are unified by our passion for the end user and our required abilities to write clear and concisely, a technical writer documenting hardware in the field of Medical Devices may have had an entirely different experience from a technical writer documenting APIs for enterprise software. 

*Simply put, an open source blogging community allows for a repository of collective experiences, bridging the gap between the different factions of Technical Writing.*
